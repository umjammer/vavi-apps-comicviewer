## TODO

 * ~~resizing when the window is larger than an image~~
 * [jpackager](https://github.com/fvarrui/JavaPackager)
   * application title
     * ~~`-Dapple.awt.application.name=Foo` doesn't work~~
     * use `macConfig.infoPlist.additionalEntries` key:`CFBundleName`
   * `macConfig.icnsFile` doesn't work?
   * `macConfig.codesignApp` true -> need `sudo` on my env -> dir removal failure
     * CONCLUSION: no need to sign
   * entitlement 
     * `macConfig.entitlements` no value: use default
     * Info.plist [sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/EnablingAppSandbox.html)
     * CONCLUSION: no need to prepare entitlement
 * drop into mac application
   * info.plist? -> right, use `CFBundleTypeExtensions` for accepting to drop
   * `CFProcessPath`? -> env
   * info.plist `:Javax:JVMVersion` doesn't work -> bundle jdk
 * ~~recent opened files menu~~
   * wip: not work on .app
 * ~~sibling files menu~~
   * wip: not work on .app
